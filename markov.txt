Vaule: bug binary to see if he saved your character on roll 20
i have all the shit except the stats in text form
and since we are buying stats those dont matter
"Stats ... dont matter?" OMGScoots
😭
THOSE stats don't matter
good job vaule, you made nahaz cry
lol
Yeah, are we doing point buy then or rolling?
Can I roll mine? 😄
yes, enef you are a snowflake and get special treatment
I personally prefer point buy, but am fine with rolling if you guys collectively want that.
i don't care really although point buy is better for roleplaying purposes
I do not want mix and match, though.  The whole reason I like point buy is it minimizes power differential between people at the start, which was an issue in my last campaign
well, last long campaing
Man, but I want to risk getting some fucked it stats 😄
Up*
How about this Enef.  You roll until you get a point buy compatible set 😛
That's no fun
You can point buy some pretty crappy stats
I still haven't decided what class yet
I decided human from Calimshan though
Female?
brave choice
Yeah
Straw: teifling warlock Vaule: human? fighter
Kree: gnome/jew merchant
Jonny: ???? Barbarian
lol. I also thought barbarian for him
He said last night he's a barb
I think a monster barb would be a good one for him if difficult
Specifically dwarves battlerager for the setting. They just wear spiky armor and throw themselves at people
I wasnt going to fight anything. Ima try and make friends with everyone and get them to join our cause. Fighting is for the weak
Dwarf might also be good actually
Cos the accent kappa
Racial profiling
Idk about john or kree
Kree wanted to be a caster? So wizard?
Kree said something about evil wizard, but we shall see
<@!146024532052803585> any idea what class you'd prefer?
huh? kree gonna be the new llama?
Well John was a wizard last campaign
I mean, I can probably write a healer into my backstory if needed
I guess that is the benefit of you guys playing WoW, balancing a party actually matters
And I have no problems being a cleric or paladin or healing Druid, I can figure that out
lol, have you seen how they play wow?
I... I have not
4head
<:shaneFail:165083387244052480>
But yeah, the secrets of my characters backstory we discussed will be a rough thing to figure into a healer background like those, unless I don't know much about the way those classes work in sword coast
Anyway, back to work, I'll be done in 2 hours and then we can talk more
Did Enef casually mention in group chat that there were secrets?
Ok, well it is dog park time for me
I'll have my phone if you need to ping me on Discord though
<@185950984692957186> test
...
Wow, <@!208978271608504320> with the harshness this morning
<@185950984692957186> IMPORTANT test!
huh?
calling me the new llama <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
enef said you want to be a caster
I'll overlook your gnome Jew merchant comment for being true <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
you can be the new synderen too
hnnnng can I wear his skin?
NO
i need that
for ....  things
Well then <:DansGame:230336967722663937>
I'll 1v1 mid you for Synderen's skin
no chance
might be able to pursade me to part with a few hair though
I don't see why you get his skin by default
just because you are closer, doesn't mean planes don't exist
thats between me and troelsypuff
ok... <:BabyRage:230336897673723904>
You guys are super weird. I like it.

And suddenly I am glad Mr "German Dungeon and Dragons Porn" Jebbu is not coming along for the ride
Dragon butt fetish is probably better than "hit on everything that moves", though
On my way home friends!
I think "hit on everything that moves" is enough to qualify someone for being smited by a god

You wanted to eat <@!111928201206382592>

I don't
damn, wanted to balance stuff out a little
didnt wanna pick like a rogue if we had 5 dps 😄
Don't worry, John will have damage
*Too much* probably
Well, thats the thing
Just hope he remembers to aim his spells 😉
I don't mind picking a healer or not, but i wasnt sure what he was doing 😄
I know everyone elses classes, pretty much
Except his and yours, but you wanted to be an evil caster so i guessed wizard or sorc
We aren't sure yet if I am playing or being like a sub-DM

I want you to play! 😄

I am the bad guy who shoots down romantic ideas D:
that is because romance is dead in Trumpsville
hey, my state went to Clinton
this aint trumpsville
My main goal from the wedding is to not get an ulcer planning it
Did your wife do most of your planning, <@185950984692957186> ?
Get me over ill sing for yous!
I was going to make a Spotify playlist, but that sounds way nicer. I mean, I've heard your singing voice and it's not horrifically jarring at all <:Kappa:230337062652477440>

<@!218176072615723008> yeah she did.  Want her advice?

I love you all
Too late my confidence is shook now
K, i have pretty much figured out a healer character now, well, in a way 😄
so ditching the previous backstory we talked about?
that reminds me, I should buy the module tonight
gonna do some timewalking if anyone wants to come
Yeah, i dont think the previous backstory would work with a healer
considering the way healers work
even bardic healing wouldnt work with that backstory, i don't think
I'll probably print of a copy of the character sheet tomorrow, cos i want to fill a proper one out as well as the roll20 one

<@185950984692957186> Are we rolling for starting wealth?
yeah why not 😄
rolling here or in roll 20?
p. 143 is where you roll your starting wealth btw, @here
lets do roll20, get them more comfortable rolling there
I am going to assume we are *not* subtracting the cost of starting gear from their starting wealth?
correct
But I worked so hard on Axebot <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
(roll20 is fine)
ok, roll20 it is <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
<@185950984692957186> are we having them buy armor?
Jonny starts with weapons, but the poor bastard is nude
he IS a barbarian, just saying
Yea I know, but even dwarves get cold
so they get clothes for free, but not armor I think
double checking
that's what I was thinking
Weapon table starts on p. 149
Explorer’s Pack (10 gp). Includes a backpack, a bedroll,
a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet o f hempen rope strapped to the side of it.

It in roll20?
yeah
Also, i want to point out, that is the second version, the first version was fucking AWFUL and i deleted it all after spending like 2 hours on it
lol
ROFL
😄
I thought you would get a kick out of it
That's my thoughts after writing for 2 and a half hours or something
would you guys kill me if i bought a pet? 😄
<@!112214247081017344> you can buy a dog for 25gp
k a p p a
bards are literally the best actually
I can just take spells from other classes

Yoyoyo
morning peoples
I think im gonna ditch the summoner with
witch
and go with a duelist infernal blow build
we'll see
Go for it.
You should try out reave or lacerate instead though probably. IB is kinda mediocre.
If you prefer ib you can always go back  to it though
<@218431140841652225> you ok btw? you dissapeared last night!
character sheet was stressin me out so just watched hte dota and football, will work on it later instead
haha
Did you need help with anything specific?
I'm not super experienced but i can offer some advice from what i know
Morning all. And yeah character sheets can be a slog the first time through, which is why the starter set has pregenerated characters to get people in game ASAP
ill just sit with it later and sort it with teh book
i was watching football and dota nad everything was super slow and annoying so closed most stuff down
slow being laggy
Oh it was a slow mess to be sure, my wife was asking what in the world I was doing after listening to me blather
I think Jonny meant slow as in laggy 😛
Well it was also just slow 😛
both, but the lag was what was annoying moreso than it being slow
Ok team, i'm gonna give Neverwinter Nights a try again, see if it catches me
gl
<@218431140841652225> so roll20 was lagging?
nah all the pdfsi had open trying to read

how is your dnd going? Any good plans to kill off Enefs character?
Well we now know what Enef's character is, more or less, so that is a step in the right direction
And Kree officially decided to co-DM, so I have a additional brain power to devote to the #KillEnef scheme
The jews are even undermining fantasy worlds now? gosh!
They always have to meddle with things dont they
See Jeb, you need to see the bright side.  She is throwing herself at a job she has no experience for.  Trump is basically her role model.

Me again
I got sick on Thanksgiving and was slowly getting better, but today I am worse
but but but planning and cackling and stuff!
My throat refuses to cackle
I am still here for planning
just with fewer dynos spinning in my coconut
put the rum in the coconut and shake it all up
i'm putting coffee in the coconut
an acceptable compromise
if you want to chat today, just PM me, otherwise rest up
John had a fever over 100 last night! *Right after getting a flu shot* hmmmm.....
I was planning to read the book as my rest
next thing we know, Kree becomes an anti-vaccer
I mean, what else can I do, read the *news*? That'd kill me. <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
skim r/awww
I feel like an anti-vaccer who is pro-vaccine, but only re: the flu shot
It's like "ok, sign up for the half-flu now so you don't get the whole flu"
and they tell you that that never happens **but it always happens**
I am not positive, but I suspect the "rare" side effects like the half-flu you are describing are not independent of the person
https://memecrunch.com/meme/2LLQR/preach-sister/image.png?w=487&c=1
So if you are the type of person that is suspectible, it will almost always happen to you
<:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
Well I'm boned now
... wow
rip
wait... did we really not consult AXEBOT for the co-DM decision?
Oh fun story
after the first few sessions, makes sense
You know how we asked him if he wanted to roll and he said no?
So, John didn't see that and came in to roll a stat later and Axebot gave him a 1
lol
rekt
That doesn't bode well <@!112214247081017344>
i will roll for axe

I feel like you called me the Sarah Palin of DMs earlier
I can see Luskan from my house!
<@218176072615723008> well the female Trump of DMs, yes
I was *so happy* when Sarah Palin was running w/ McCain...
It was all in a bid to restore Jebbu to his rightful state, though
Little did I know what I was cheering on 😦
Why were you happy?
Like first serious female VP candidate?
Because it meant women were finally allowed to be as publicly stupid as men
Gotcha
Usually women have to be the Best of the BEST
So men just had to elevate their game a few elections down the line?
But a sub-mediocre woman potentially in a position of power?! THAT is progress
lol
Exactly
That opened the door, apparently, to pumpkin spice berlusconi
See that is the problem with Trump, though
or let's say a symptom of the terminally ill republican party
He praises Putin, he gets compared to Berlusconi... and yet he is just a pale imitation of those guys
idk... he's pretty berlusconi-ish
Stupid, yes, but nowhere near the strong man appeal
you mean orange imitation
Berlusconi's sex parties and influence make Trump look like a kid running for elementary school president
I like how he's not even president yet and he's already caused two international incidents
oh you poor naive progressive leftist .....
<@185950984692957186> he *did* have those, though... He was being  charged for raping a 13 year old at a sex party
like he was in court for it
beliving the lies your media tells you  ....
after all those women came out she freaked out and dropped the case because of the death threats the women were getting
your presidents are nothing compared to our grim reaper
Fair
But the media couldn't talk about it because *emails*
You mean the media that some insane percentage of the US believes is a bunch of liars?
I think they lack professionalism, but sheesh
Deep breaths, though.  DnD... we can make Faerun a happy place.

You know what, lets scrap SKT entirely

note they said "human" in the title
Yes, but I learned a new term: Murder hobo!
Murderhobo*
rofl: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5gc7uy/my_players_just_completed_a_4_session_long_quest/darm6dk/
Oh yes, there is much DM slang to learn
<@!146024532052803585> just cheese-punned at me!
do share!
He said "such goudaness"
when I told him there was ☕ brewed, but the emoji looked like bean soup with cheese on top
cheese in bean soup <:WutFace:230337422746058752>
cheese is good in all things
i disagree, even though i love cheese
there are some things that don't go together
uh
cheese on top of bean soup is a classic combo
you cray
no, you put meat in bean soup, and then try to find the beans amongs the meat
preferably smoked pork ribs
<@!112214247081017344> I would like to make a quick note that although you are the sworn enemy of Axe, you are planning on using handaxes.  That is all
thats why i will throw them only
"get away from me!  quickly and accurately!"
also they are usefull for chopping down trees
you havent event started playing and vaule is already planning to throw -.-
each tree in Faerun has a dryad spirit inside of it you monster
i have many throwable objects
people burn dung to generate heat and light there instead
although thats sounds reasonable, gathering enough fish dung would prove difficult
....
10/10
figures
losses his voice
cant sing
its fine the dryads can just move elsewhere
the first mime bard in the world
he then needs to learn sign language
<@!208978271608504320> I figure they know I am joking.  But if they ever start narrating how the collect their dung from the latrine and bring it over to the fire pit, well....
"I want to domesticate this beefalo and have it follow us around for its dung."
actually getting a donkey or horse would be better
I was debating a pupper
cos you can buy a mastiff for 25gp
hypocritical leftist! <@185950984692957186> FUCK THE DRYADY BUT WE CANT HAVE A PIPELINE BENEFITING MILLIONS!
1. transport of goods and people 2. generates fuel for burning
i saw the map with the exsisting pipelines
What a shitty idea Vaule <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
meanwhile we are like "pls puting give us a pipeline so we dont pay 3 times more for fuel"
and hes like "idk bae you're getting to friendly with them americans"
Hmm. Dryads… tree hugging… Something tells me that's not Tree Sidehugging
Go back to bed <@!146024532052803585>, you are not well 😛

uno what phone do you have
If I don't keep watch Meek will show up as a level 20 sorcerer servant of Tiamat
uno is a samsung galaxy s6 kind of person
no, google nexus
no way, he might have an htc though
idk, htc-microsoft basicly
if he owns an iphone i am unfriending
he has european origins so there might be hope he doesn't
<@!146024532052803585> always trying to keep the Meek down, sad
<@!146024532052803585> don't just toss around wizardy words i don't understand
<@!111928201206382592> iPhone 6 which is also my first smart phone, but <@!112214247081017344> is right I am switching to a Google Pixel w/e when the contract is up
I have the same phone and will probably do the same
But
Pathfinder adventures is available for free on iOS
you know the board/card game
I do not
removed
I'm sure you played it with binary in TTS
I missed the TTS craze, although that one does sound vaguely familiar
"offers in-app purchases" of course it does
what doesnt these days?
thanks for the heads up, though, grabbing it
Our lord and saviour TIAMAT! What you see is what you get!
<@!146024532052803585> and I had not thought about a Meek cameo, although with Kree involved...
<:wizardhat:240139380658798603>
<:Kappa:230337062652477440>
🎩👹
👹
you are what you eat
and Meek had already eaten at least one fancy book
I'll refrain from the obvious retort
<@!111928201206382592> Kree "rescued" a kobold called Meek in the last campaign, a point of contention amongst the players who had different views on how DnD and its NPCs should be treated
I know
I remember hearing about it, multiple times
😛
the eventual compromise had the kobold working as a servant for the local wizard/historian type
I think I was sick for this part
and near the end of the campaign the party had to defuse a situation when Meek had decided to rip apart and eat one his old texts
At least I wasn't a Murderhobo on my very second campaign!
And my first real one
I dunno Kree, after your one token rescue you were more than happy to kill the rest of the monsters in the campaign
I was reading the DnD subreddit last night and remembering my "first" one
Was this with the crazy ex?
They were enemies in battle!
Yes, yes it was!
Thought so, I have vague recollections of it
Haha I hadn't realized I had told you
Well I remember the involved party and "weird"
We lived together with a roommate, who was a DM
but specifics fail me
He offered to DM a campaign for just the two of us to let me try out DnD
since I hadn't played
so I spent **HOURS** making a character with their help
sounds familiar <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
And then my shitty boyfriend literally killed me as soon as we started the campaign
Like, within moments. "You are in a forest at night"
so I was like "I put up my tent"
and my boyfriend SET IT ON FIRE WITH HIS TORCH AND BURNED ME ALIVE INSIDE
And then the DM was like "Well, that's it. You're dead."
The end.
Fuck both of them
I hope you went to bed with a fire extinguisher that night
Considering how it turned out with him, I probably should have kept a gun
But nobody wants to hear "that time my ex tried to kill us both because I broke upw ith him" stories, I mean that's no fun
So the point was that MEEK was a captive
and you don't must murder unarmed captives
At least, *Rolen* doesn't 😛
well you don't if you are good aligned, no
If I had been an evil character I probably would have just slit his throat, party unity be damned
<@!111928201206382592> have you tried playing this game yet?
a little
only applies to humans kree
it works exactly as the board game does, from what i remember
<@!111928201206382592> it keeps telling me to log in, but doesn't give me a way to do it
huh, worked fine for me
D&D doesn't exactly lend itself to applications of the insights of modern psychology, does it?
i think having future presidential candidates play D&D beforehand would be awesome
Like, it can't be that Meek grew up in a cult worshiping the Kobold god and that's why he was going to stab us.  Meek was a Kobold and therefore Evil.
Depends on the game I suppose
which is why I need you to reply with your playstyle choices <@!146024532052803585> ! 😛
I read that thingy then couldn't find it again under all the D&D paperwork
<@!112214247081017344> It would be a great insight into their character!
lol
paperwork... man character generation can be such a drag :/
It should be so much fun, but sheesh
I actually like it D:
I think I approve of 5E wizard spell system.  It almost resembles 3E psyonics
It's like doing a research paper!
<@218176072615723008> it is just a lot to do before you can start, thoguh
Yes, like a research paper!
lol
Well you have plenty more reading to do
I know ❤
Is Tiamat in, like, all the worlds?
she is pretty popular I think
Tiamat is the big bad of dragons though right
like, even in non dnd lore i dont think tiamat is good
<@!111928201206382592>  the goddess queen, yes
and yes, evil
lies!
IIRC DnD lore split into chromatic and metallic dragons, with metallic being the good aligned ones
yeah
chromatic are bad, metallic good
Bahamut is another one thats kind of in everything
on the metallic side
Also, the Sword Coast Manual is apparently somehow written by Volo because it takes a first-person "I" tone and it takes a tone of being quite bored with Mystras repeated resurrections
<@!146024532052803585> the whole mystra stuff was stupid, lets be honest
Oh it's been stupid since the Time of Troubles.  I read the books!  It was stupider there.
Volo is the best
If you want a fun read, check out the playable races in the Guide to Monsters
i will once my actual hard copy arrives this Wednesday
assuming it doesn't once again show as "delivered" and yet not be there
The postlady is stealing your DnD books!
Hopefully there is another good sale around Chirstmas so I can get the DM and MM
She's gone *rouge*
oh lawd
I picked up a players handbook for £25
*rouge*
Which isnt bad
keep trying
**rouge**
KEEP TRYING
but i was hoping to get one for around 15, if possible
<:KappaClaus:230337078867656704>
😄
But oh well, beggars can't be choosers
<@!111928201206382592> 15 is what... about 20 dollars?
yeah, but we didnt have the sale here
so i just broke and bought it for £25 instead
well I thnk you guys had the same sale, but not that additional coupon code
<@185950984692957186> John was saying to me last night that he was worried because he wasn't caught up on current FR history and I was like... "Yea.... don't worry about that" 😛
"Only Uno will know anything about that, anyway"
<@218176072615723008> yeah having a FR historian who knows more than you can be frustrating as a DM
AND IW AS RIGHT
haha
because frequently you want to make deviations FOR THE STORY
Damn nerds, amirite?
(also because you have no idea and are bullshitting)
\o/
(but dont tell them that, the DM is always in control of the situation and had planned for this oh my god what have they done)
thats why you make your own world
then you are god
There are pros and cons for that
Using a relatively well known setting can be helpful in getting players running, and less mismatched expectation
ofc ^^
@here dota?
cat hand numbhg
cat has sat on his hand, and there is no blood flow left
Why are electrum pieces a thing?
no idea, and probably won't use them
decimal system or bust yo
lol, in a fantasy world why would anyone say "I think that there sword is worth 250 and a HALF of a gold!"
<@218431140841652225> dota?
well there are silver and coper
<@!112214247081017344> is afraid of axe lol
I think we should only do electrum <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
^
NOT OKAY, AXEBOT
great, he's working with enef
that does not soud like axe
just shout it, jeb...

nobody is immune to axes charm, it is known
<@227523189687844864> <@!208978271608504320> <@!112214247081017344> dota? :<
I can play if we get a party going.
cant
studying
also no hand
coward
Uno how much damage can a hook do?
where did your hand go?! We told you it was just a game and you didn't have to fully roleplay a pirate!
I KNEW IT WAS A HOOK
1d4 piercing, i'd guess
I think 1d6 I mean
fresh meat?
<@218176072615723008> i'm guessing you're too sick for dotes?
cat is hardcore dnd playrt
<@!111928201206382592> yes, sorry 😦
throat hurts don't want to be talky
also dizzy
a rapier is 1d8, i don't think a hook has that much damage
but we already established that vaule is a swole pirate
he has a lot of force behind these attacks
but its like, a pulling motion right, not a stab, it's unnatural 😄
<@!208978271608504320> come play you noob
nice
I'd think a hook is most similar to a sickle or improvised weapon, so 1d4
^
fail
I knew it!
You guys clearly have no faith in Vaule
It's not about vaule
it's about the weapon
If he plays a game of Pudge and hits five consectuive hooks, we can make it a 1d6 <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
the weapon dictates the dice, not the person! 😄
wait no, need to be more specific
five consecutive hooks on enemy heroes who are not bots or afk
I bet there's a house rule for a hook somewhere
ummm... ok nevermind this challenge he is going to be crafty
http://i.imgur.com/Vr62WBS.jpg
guessed correct
I reached out to the company's customer support to see if I had any other options
fingers crossed I hear something today
huh?
Oh is Honey responding by text to voice inquiries?
He was responding to me
https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Hookshot_(3.5e_Equipment)
that isn't going to be at all confusing <:Keepo:230337123348250624>
Thats the closest i could find
and thats firing from a gun
for the wrong ruleset
pshaw
its 1d4
Is the damage for a sword or a axe that different between 3.5 and 5e?
dunno, lunch time though!
But i agree, 1d4 is about right
I'M SPEAKING
YOU JUST CAN'T HEAR ME
No it's not 😦

My wife and I have been nursing colds from the nieces and nephews, but nothing like you guys 🤒
Also while you are both here, <@218176072615723008> you should scold <@140270408443232256> because I am not getting through
Why should we scold her
Maybe we should scold *you*
She is driving in the front passenger seat with her teenage boyfriend who just got his license
omfg
lol
<@140270408443232256> have fun with your boyfriend!
NOOOOOOOO
AHAH shes on my side!
I am totally on your side

I don't think you're 13 👼
I remember all the shit I was doing at 16

<@218176072615723008> I do too, that is why I know teenage boys are complete idiots
All I'm saying is that you are *way* better behaved than I was 😄
I mean, we don't actually know what she is doing
no evidence of that kree
Although I am going to side with Kree on this and continue to believe that Erica is still stream baby of innocence
I feel like I'm being asked to prove my cred haha
Despite mounting evidence to the contrary
<@218176072615723008> you did wander in the murder haunted woods
I was older then
that should be enough cred
oh nm then
at 16 it was pretty much sex, drugs, and rock
I mean it's out of my system so that is something
no roll?
while erica is dance, cheerleading and dota
Naaa, I wasn't into E
everyone I knew who did E was an idiot

it is a really cool pop-up event, no? 😄
well if i was the king
sure
no see if you were king you just got dethroned
no, i'd light everybody on fire and guide them to the light
... back to being worried about Vaule in the DnD campaign
its fine i'm lawfull neutral
pretty sure lighting people in fire isn't covered there
well i found a reddit post that described lawfull neutrall
like "when in rome do as romans"
so if others are lighting people on fire i'll try to fit in
... i see...
Just wait until Kree is charge, 'kay?

Kree doesn't have legs, she has a second pair of arms
that explains sick dota skills
only sort of, she is always playing skyrim on the side see

I actually started typing that i'd come play

All our friends are dead
but then the thought of watching little people move on the screen made me dizzy
awww
It's ok, don't push yourself
It's better that you get better
Yea I'd better get better because this is irritating
I have like 20 things I'd rather be doing than laying around watching netflix 😦
but gl finding people healthy enough to play dota ❤
Ill be home round half 8. Prolly gonna work though
<@227523189687844864> dota time
<@218176072615723008> don't you hate it when Netflix/Dropbox removes shows/songs at a moment's notice? <:Keepo:230337123348250624>
Should I put my playstyle in my character sheet or message someone?
ummm, you can put it there yeah
those are just visible to you right now I think
<@185950984692957186> What *ever* could you mean? 😉
😄
Also, there's a "Bio & Info" tab and in my character sheet there's a "Bio" tab.  Which is for what?
<@!146024532052803585> the one on the character sheet is there to copy the format for dnd 5e, whereas the other is general to all "characters" in roll20
just use the character sheet one for now I think
stupid censorship

also I note you are in the passenger seat again... but self-driving correction and stuff.... I AM CONFUSED AS TO WHAT TO DO
wait is that a tesla?
Yes
hes never going to learn to drive if hes driving a tesla
you start with a Yugo or a Lada
a real mans car
hands off Vaule, it can self-drive to me, I am on the same continent!
His car is in the shop
<@112214247081017344> well he already wrecked his first car <:Keepo:230337123348250624>
So his dad let him use the tesla

He's a good driver lol the person that hit him wasn't
You keep sending me evidence to the contrary!
when my grandad gave me to drive his lada
he said " it pulls to the left under braking, and dont go to fast the rear brakes dont work
^ that is more like it
there car i have now
its very hhard to get 5th gear
which is actually a safety feature so yuou dont drive fast
manual transmission, too right?
none of this automatic garbage
This car is sexy tho IDK guys
yes
OF COURSE IT IS SEXY
ITS ELECTRIC
LIKE THE SLIDE
We were driving down a hill and he's like watch imma take my foot off both pedals
And we stopped
Completely

BOTH HANDS
ON THE WHEEL
AT ALL TIMES
this is sexy <:Kappa:230337062652477440> http://i.imgur.com/cG16mFn.jpg
YOUNG MAN
isn't it a different color now?
no its this
this is after the repaint <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
💔
also if you go over 40mph you cant hear the radio
so it implies you should drive slower
That would make my drives to TN rough :/
it is tiresome on the highway long drives when all you hear is engine wind noise
<@185950984692957186> did you read this UA for fighter yet?
no
It's really interesting
Arcane Archer seems really fun
I'll take a peek tonight
did Straw go to bed?
yeah
she said she sent you her stuff
She did, had a follow-up question but not important
what was it? I can ask her if ou want
naw its not time sensitive either, just didn't want to PM her if she was heading off
cool, well, if you leave her a message she'll probably pick it up tomorrow
just adress it "To Strawbery, in the Kingdom of Pols, The Land of Knights"
Holy Knights or Paladins perhaps?
i think Holy Knights, as the Papacy had many holy orders in the kingdom of poland to combat the pagan heretics
it is decided
Did i just see bandit launch dota
She does from time to time

Ok, i thought doing the tutorials on mordheim would make it easier to understand
but this game is nothing like i thought
I move with WASD?
I can't remember tbh
It has been a while
I thought it was like an isometric strategy game of sorts
It is
its third person for me o.O
but has a very different controls cheme from post
Oh well yes, sorry
there is also a top-down strategy view
but you are right, mostly third-person
I thought it was more xcom like than this
but its cool, i think
I thnk this is a game i need to sit and play with someone who knows what they are doing 😄
Camponotus or binary
does anyone here not have psychonauts and want a copy?
same with goat simulator
and guns of icarus
Good morning friends o/
o/
anyone playing the dotes?
Just checking out the predictions
no worrries 😃
What the blazes is goat simulator
its a VR game made after a category in pornhub

Look it up on YouTube Jonny, it's pretty funny and dumb
<@!111928201206382592> enjoy https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5gqhth/oc_my_players_did_some_dm_shaming/
http://i.imgur.com/atGoqlb.png
the question is not why does google have responses for that
context
the question is WHY did you search for that?
haha ok
DM shaming is funny 😄
I love dnd
These topics are perfect examples of why
well one day you will get to play <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
I'm leaning more towards the new year, though
Nooooo don't do this
I bet everyone will lose steam by then
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5gqeqj/the_bard_uses_the_halfling_as_a_projectile/
weeeeeeee
<@!111928201206382592> as to losing steam, I just don't think I can get enough prep done for the 18th since I am traveling for work all next week and it is looking like it will be rather stressful
dont rush it Uno
<@!111928201206382592> is in a hurry because of brexit and probable loss of communication with the rest of the world
lol
good morning, friends. I feel like i've been gargling razor blades
hooray text chat?
I see <@!208978271608504320> has finally entered his final form
hooray, indeed.
good juice on facebook this morning, too
there is only DnD sourcebooks, no juice <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
dammit, <@112214247081017344> , stop cutifying my food
but I hadn't even gotten out of bed yet <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
and it was good juice!
It's on my neighborhood's facebook. They're calling it "roachgate"
silly americans, if its not a war on something it has to be a -gate
Apparently, the local Dunkin Donuts had a roach infestation and instead of dealing with it they kept serving people
until someone finally shamed them on the facebook page with videos of roaches crawling everywhere
ahhmhahf ... i mean ... I bring an end to magic!
including floating in their tea
Now, the DD in question claims they have dealt with it, while others say they can never be trusted again!
We have local DD workers showing up in the thread saying he doesn't walk 2.5 miles to work everyday to poison people
And that by refusing to "support" DD in this difficult time they are running them out of town
other people say it's "fine" and it's not "neighborly" to refuse to shop there
then we have people saying it's a *false flag* carried out by disgruntled employees!
<@!208978271608504320> have a 🍪
HAHA, i vow thy ruin 🍪 !
our local donut store closed, and tears filled the streats
there is a krispy kreme on the way back from the dog park
only done that twice, though
krispy kreme >>>>>>>> dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts isn't even worth eating at
unless you are <@!146024532052803585> and like the taste of roach in the morning <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
it has proteins
Figures, his taste has always been suspecct <:KappaClaus:230337078867656704>
and its crunchy
wwooooowww
<@185950984692957186> Begone, vile creature!
Clearly we need an antimage bot that responds in antimage lines whenever jeb speaks
I don't think AM would be my first choice
The path is clear!
Come on kree, we need gender equailty <:Keepo:230337123348250624>
Meepo bot, that responds 5 times
There is nothing more equal than an all-powerful woman commanding her army of men to do her bidding. <:KappaPride:230337103039430656>
Pretty sure that is just sexism
When I do it it's *cute* though
Yeah, and I have the metal songs to prove it
Thou art a devil, pure and simple.
Industrial!
Which, btw, DID save in iTunes and start randomly playing
hahaha
nice
rip yer ears
I was all "ok, lets start the audiobook back up".... nope
you're lucky I didn't send the one with the lyric "www dot murder you toight dot com!"
yes, very cute
you wanna know whats real metal? 🤘 Listening to your audiobook on Shuffle!
I did that on mistake once
on GoT of all things
And since it does jump between characters, I didn't catch it at first
did it pull you into an alternate dimension where TWoW is released?!
it did not
and anyway
Door of Stone is the one I want
GRRM was probably the only person I was upset to see campaigning for Hillary
I was like "YOU HAVE A BOOK TO WRITE"
"BEFORE YOU FUCKING DIE"
Oooo! Did you see that Lin-Manuel Miranda is involved in the KKC tv shows and movies?!
http://www.thewrap.com/lin-manuel-miranda-produce-feature-film-tv-series-kingkiller-chronicle/
I see *now*
uno is gay for lin mauel
I am still waiting for this magical world where us country peasants can see Hamilton before I get excited about LMM
how could you not be?
not aryan
have you HEARD the guy rhapsodize?
NO BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE COUNTRY
The most important thing in my life is whether the roaches at the local donut shop were placed by disgruntled employees to frame the business
I'm all about that shit if they put it on Netflix for us lowly hill folk
I miss <@!132676416775913472> 😦
why does he not love us?
I dont like this new trend of killing of 90% of all main characters, fuck grr
You haven't spurned him enough
I know we aren't sexy elves
Blizzard bans him, and he runs back to them
i would be very sexy elf
That must be it
He apparently likes the tough love
very abusive relationship #fuckblizzard
I used to have a whip...
time for an intervention?
_covers Erica's eyes_
all i am hearing we ban <@!132676416775913472> and then beg him to come back to discord
Leave poor Erica alone
and a nice christmas vaccation in snowy norway?
one way is to keep ganking him in wow
but thats to much effort
Like 95% of the time, getting rear-ended is the fault of the person DOING the rear-ending like
He plays on PvE servers
oh right
huh?
what a scrub
I'm lost on the rear ending
car crash
Oh, her bf's driving? lol
You are complaining about Erica's boyfriend getting rear-ended
butts and whips
She didn't mention he was rear-ended to start with
He was rear-ended!
And yeah, rear-ended is almost always the other persons fault
sure
Unless he slammed on the brakes with no warning at a super high speed, it's probably not his fault
I need diagrams now
what if he did the russian thing where he backs up into somebody to claim insurance money
I think the traffic report should have it <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
he's too young and pure to think of that, <@112214247081017344>
you dont use a car for insurance scams
Oh now who is dreaming Kree?!
you could if it shity
still too much papertrail
<@140270408443232256> come defend your man's honor!
If I don't get to falsely believe Erica is innocent, why do you?
She is at school or something!
Getting lots of useful knowledge
Because public schools are top notch
And education in Murica is highly valued
it occurs to me that when I got in *my* accident, Erica wasn't even born, yet 😮
.... damn
She may have been an embryo though
i found a picture http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_640x430/public/3270983-565x411_4.jpg

spinning out is scary stuff man
I didn't spin out
steering failed in the middle of a left turn
I did a collision avoidance training run by police, they had us hydroplane and stuff
Mitsubishi Eclipses were like the shiny dumpster of cars
HOLY CRAP
YOU HAD AN ECLIPSE?!
No, my sister did, and it was a piece of shit
that was my college car ❤
UNO, THE STEERING FAILED
lol then you know
also HER BUMPER FELL OFF
like, randomly
very nice looking car, but holy shit
thats what they are supposed to do
women and cars .... tstststs
i had the exaust fall of mine
sounded like a nascar whilst driving to the repair shop
hahaha
yay for shitty cars with bits randomly falling off
The thermostat on my eclipse went out on the highway
Oh?
suddenly started losing power and steam starts billowing out from under the hood
"uh oh"
<:LUL:230373447232913409>
also i broke my uncles clucths pedal while driving, so had to drive back without a pedal, only the pointy bit
<@112214247081017344> !!! owwww?!
dang, that is rough
My car was a dream until my shitty ex boyfriend wrecked it
my grandad who is a mechanic of old said i am the perfect person to find whats broken on a car
afterwards it was never the same, started giving me random electric shocks
same shitty boyfriend, or other one?
and now I am classicaly trained to fear driving 😦
I only ever had the 1 shitty boyfriend
the rest were 👼
Uh hai
I thought you had a string of 💩 before Daelin 👼

<@!132676416775913472> as long as we stay friends <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>

@here
leavin now
back round half 9 ish
I have razors in my throat and fire ants in my sinuses
i read that as anus intially gg
there, too
i can do whatever
is that a storm i hear in the disctance <@!111928201206382592>?
Could we be heroes? Of a storm?
reading this adventure, I am really looking forward to our sessions
it's really good
you guys are going to have a blast 😄
I heard good things
I think you would also like Curse of Strahd a lot too Kree
Do you watch any D&D shows?
<@112214247081017344> binary and campo will play too
I have watched the one w/ Wil Wheaton
with the penny arcade guys
Good choice
Chris Perkins is a GREAT DM
though their later adventures are really good too, without WW
I tried listening to their podcasts, but they would randomly leave out sessions or have sessions that don't work D:
Patrick Rothsbuergetrgerg takes Wil Wheatons place
yea, Chris Perkins is #DMGoals
binary msg me earlier
so im game
I would suggest, if you are interested in other shows, "Critical Role" (matt mercer is sick at DM'ing also) but it kind of picks up in the middle of a campaign and they have a bunch of early audio issues
Also, High Rollers, which is an entirely british/yogscast show
Chris Perkins also does an online campaign called "Dice, Camera, Action!"
Which is a bunch of famous?(id never heard of them but youtubers and the like) people playing Curse of Strahd
<@185950984692957186> probably has more podcast like ones to listen to, but i only really watch the youtubes
I watched two or three episodes of Harmon Quest, was quite funny
Seems pretty good, Jeb
Thanks for the suggestion 😄
@here games?
i'd like to play "pull the razors out of krees throat" <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
I'll let john know, he can help with his TONGUE
k a p p aq
do you really want to disrupt super secret DM planning? <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
his throat is just as razory
also that, too
Good news! <@185950984692957186> is a GOOD COP DM 👼
meanwhile Kree just wants to kill everybody, but legally
rude
I believe the term for that is BAD COP <:CorgiDerp:230336956846833665>
I think it will be a fun balance for you guys
How do you find your balance between wanting your players to succeed and wanting to punish them horribly?

Haha, well, I don’t believe in “punishing” players as much as “justifying how the world would react to terrible player decisions.” I want the players to succeed, as I am hoping to guide them along a heroic journey to glory and victory, but you have to constantly be aware that the dangers of the world around them take no sides. I feel you must play a game that doesn’t exude a “DM vs Player” mentality, but instead a “Players vs The World: DM is just the neutral judge and jury” atmosphere. That being said, it’s also okay to enjoy a little sadistic peril every now and then.
Best quote about dm'ing, from Matt Mercer
sounds about right
Her literal quote was "if they run in like idiots..."
HEY NOW! What happens in super secret dm planning session should stay in super secret dm planning session!
What if that's your character, though
Then the environment will respond accordingly
survival of the fittest
I mean, that's like a FL Man question
lol
Like, there are people that like to feed gators in FL, but it doesn't always work out
or it might be in their "character" to set off homemade fireworks
also doesn't always work out
I mean, i'm pretty sure i'm going to be avoiding as much direct combat as possible
So i'm not worried for me 😄
what if a kobold starts stabbing straw to death?
IS IT METAGAMING TO REFUSE TO LEAVE YOUR WOMAN?!
She's not my girlfriend in game
straw or her character?
hahahaha
hahahah ok

if you are a believer in mean as a habit, then yes

Well the other owner was laughing
Because she does know us a bit
And it is her son that is the shitty "ignore puppy and leave him on the back porch"
ah
So I bet there is mutual "omg they think I am the worst"

The problem is I tell my friends at the dog park about this and they don't think I am serious, they just can't see it
I mean
Picture Loiosh when he was with you here
and then picture him again when you first arrived
Oh I know
Loiosh doesn't seem capable of being a meanie, either
<:doge:249199257435897857>
they are strange creatures
They are indeed
OH!
My cousin-in-law that lives in town and adores Sami
She just went and got a two year old Great Dane from a rescue
DOGE FRIEND!
😮
great danes scare me
What, why?!
idk
They are absolute sweeties
they have scared me since i was a kid
no idea
Eh, can't argue with that
Of the large breeds, they are the least scary to me because of their personality
i'm fine around other large breeds
it's like
great dane specific
Like huskies/malamutes are super stinkers, and coupled with the size can be serious problems
But danes are really gentle, and their size just gets them into trouble.   "Ooops, knocked that over because I forgot by body was that long"
At least that has been my experience with them, both with my brothers and at the dog park
it is not a rational fear
i've never even had a bad experience
I get it, not trying to convince you
Just ... reassure?
it isn't reassuring, though
it's like a physical fear reaction
I am aware that they are no scarier than any other big dog 😛
I told you about the King Corso mastiff that comes to the park, right?
i don't remember
*cane corso, sorry
omg, such a dufus
have a pic?
Let me check if I have a good one, I don't think so
I have one of him and Sami and a great dane playing
but lets avoid that one <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
i can look at pictures
they are very cute in pictures!
like I said it's super weird, just a physical reaction
I WILL BE OK LOOKING AT A PICTURE OF A GD
its also not a great picture of how dufus he is
But I don't seem to have any better, so let me upload it, sec

sami is ridonk
ok, so you can barely see it because it is the dog's left side of the mouth which is away from the camera
but his teeth are worn down on that side because of shitty pre-rescue owners
that *is* sami fro the back, right?
the end result... he can't keep his tongue in his mouth
because the pink thing is cute
IT IS ALWAYS DANGLING ABOUT 😛
derp
so derp, haha
and it is a BIG tongue
yeah, that is Sami play boying at them
fever and all
just wanted to make sure
I try to avoid taking pictures at the park that don't have my dog in them
which means I am forever trying to get Sami to play with certain dogs so I can have an excuse to take pictures of them 😄
yea i thought it was sami
but you can always ask the owner if you can get a pic of their dog if you think they are cute
most people are flattered
loiosh has been stopped a lot for pics
It's true
when he isn't being fierce
he had a lot of fans at the dog park before he was fierce
but he is totally fine with all humans away from the house
Sami can be a nervous wreck depending on location
he is <:doge:249199257435897857>
silly doge
poor sami
you should have that embroidered on a scarf and have her wear it
then take a pic, for science ofc
"silly doge"?
no, "Poor Sami"
ah, haha
so I should ship Sami up for training?
wow
I'm pretty sure she is just nervous by nature
<@218176072615723008> she definitely is nervous by nature
oooookay
lets ignore brokebot wanting to kill Jebbu and take pictures for posterity
boxers are usually super outgoing, but Sami's mother was also nervous
darn genetics strike again
damn them!
wow
that series was immense
great start to the major!
I was not spoiling, what I read was "it's s great module and apparently the module book is really in depth for dms" lol
If I wanted to spoil it I would have read the book
It is true
That is why I have edited the book in Dropbox with false leads
carefully drawing in each scanned page <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
we also may have a sixth player, but not sure yet
@here  come watch majors with vaule and i friends
come and judge players who are way better than us about the mistakes they make
yyyyeehhhh
still at work so I can't join voice
but I'll type my judgement with EMPAHSIS
I will continue to drip quietly on my sofa
drip... eww....
http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/a/ac/FFX_Malboro.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20120718194839
.... well then
What did you guys do to Vaule?
i have ascended
now i can master meepo
Unfortunately for you, google exists and Dropbox is not the only place for pdfs :p
Also cool, Nick I presume?
Looks like a beholder
Yeah, I haven't heard confirmation yet
plant-holder
Still a little retarded
Cool, any idea what class? He wanted to bard last night but I informed him of my choice already 😄
Nope, if he confirms he wants in then I'll tell him what classes we have going
Like, I don't think more bars are ever a bad thing
Bards*
But he might want to go something else 😄
If you guys promise to sing duets, you can both be bards
rude
when we meet up you will have to have a bard off
and the losser can not longer be a bard
all this ingame though
lol
after we start
AND the victory can smash the losers instruments
"there can only be one bard"

What in the world did you just have me watch.
and here i was hoping for Dr. Uno to able to explain ME!
I think she wants to kill us all
<@!208978271608504320> sadly scientific funding in serbia is not enough to tackle the task at hand
ah, ok, thats not so bad then
was worried she was gonna suck my soul out and skin my puppy alive
No. she likes your puppy because of how it looks
yes, so she is gonna kill it and stuff it,  so it can remain pristine <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
... oh god you are right.
what? NO! AHHHHHHHHHH
but she made a fatal mistake of teaching you how to load a gun
now all you need to do is sell your country to trump or putin to make shooting people legal
Sure, a diabolical mind like hers would never purposefully leave off an important step to cripple us like furniture assembly instructions
furniture assembly instructions are tomes of evil
It is known
we bought a shoe cabinet or whatever its called
the instructions were in french
Lol
so we turned it into a giant puzzle
Google translate help much?
yeah
but it was a pain
Good story though 😃
i am sorry my cat doesn't go to parks <:Kappa:230337062652477440>

I did the equivalent of duct-taping him together to get him to minimally run

he only responds to enefisms
@axe at least you are perfect

So Axe is basically all my own code
brokebot relies pretty heavily on a third-party library that is old and needs work
right
i'm pretty proud of axebot, tbh. he is solid AF and hard to break

So did you see the thing about how ridiculously uninformd Trump voters are?
the polling, I mean
Negatory
Put polls are lies
I will dig that up for you in a second because first I want to show you this...
we are post-truth Kree, POST-TRUTH
I was confused how they could be so fucking ignorant
so I went to foxnews.com ....
Well you see... oh I was about to say where they get their info lol
*screams internally... also externally a bit*
this is the **most** trustworthy source of news they use
And is probably better now that Ailes is out
so... yeah...

MSNBC, really you want me to go to that den of evil? <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
I don't know if there is a single headline there that isn't, shall we say, at least somewhat problematic
to put it lightly
like their big headline -- calling it a "parting shot" to make sure that, you know, our democracy is actually intact
"trump meets with parade of liberals after accusations of divisiveness" I mean
Pope Franci pulled into 'fake news' debate -- as if 'fake news' are alleged and not fucking real
then they have a tiny bit on hillary clinton talking about the epidemic of fake news and then an immediate rebuttal "Kellyanne Conway on 'fake news' claims" I mean
lol, well you can hardly blame people for believing there was Voter Fraud when their primary source is Trump tweeting it himself
and THIS IS THEIR MOST ACCURATE SOURCE
like
THIS IS THEIR MOST REPUTABLE SOURCE
THE **MOST** REPUTABLE
it's no wonder they are so fucking ignorant
'reputable'
we can use quotes too, assholes
I can't even, Uno
I just can't
and yet
<@185950984692957186> 😮 Mr. Polak?!?

Well that game 2 of VP vs EG was pretty epic
<@185950984692957186> i was just reading some thread on /r/dnd about some person who is new to DND and is worried that they are annoying their group because they feel shy to roleplay, they zone out sometimes and they sometimes get so excited they scream out loud
and some dude responded with this: "The screaming would get you kicked from my table if it happened more than once, honestly. Focusing on notes and details might help."
How fucking awful is that
If people are getting so invested in the game that they physically can't help but scream, i would love that
Are you selective about who you play Dota with?
I like NICE people
😄
And some people have different preferences
So while I would not kick someone for it, I don't think it is awful
WEIRD
I think its pretty awful
the most fun of playing video games for me is when people get really into it
Sure, but local gets into games
and you don't paricularly enjoy playing with him
some things tick people off *shrugs*
I guess
Its weird
No, that is Straw
what, weird? 😄
I know 😄
yes
her backstory
and character
I told Kree
I tried to warn you
"its almost like she and Enef would make a good couple"
That's why i told her to run everything by you before getting too attached to anything
We've already realized that Straw is the Murderhobo and you're the only other one who knows it.
That girl is insane.
But i fucking love her
❤
She would have to be <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
Like, from the sides of us both you see
you would think she was the calming influence
😄
I dunno
I have Polish relatives
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5heyem/scared_that_i_might_be_my_groups_that_guy/?st=iwibqmf4&sh=7959ce34
I told the person that if they ever have problems with their group, we'll take them in 😄
lol, that top comment
"First of all, never underestimate the ability of men to put up with crap from random women."
how goes that make you feel <@218176072615723008> ? 😉
rofl
I mean
the guy isnt wrong
what counts as crap?
men are WAY more forgiving to women than they are to men
when it comes to being annoyed
<@218176072615723008> she was saying she is the youngest in the group and sometimes screams out of excitement
Also tends to run in without thinking and zone out at times
hahaha, this one: "Think you're that guy, half my group is that guy, we're basically "it's always sunny in neverwinter""
<@!111928201206382592> it depends on how attractive the woman is
dudes won't put up with shit if she isn't good looking
and no Enef, it depends on the guy and context
if it is a girl in a "male activity" then they could get more flack, not less
I think as a general rule of thumb, if there are no existing pictures of said woman, the men will most likely put up with more shit than if it was a guy
in my experience playing both competitive and non-competitive
well, as an expert in this / *puts on glasses* / you get more shit and more leeway in 'male activities'
There are many female medics in high level tf2 that probably should be in mid-low level tf2, for example.
except in pub games when a girl uses a mic and instantly the vitriol starts flowing?
It's both
You get people who are too nice and people who are too shitty
yeah
I remember duo queuing with Lox way back when and it was beyond shitty
That's why I like you guys. You're *just shitty enough*
Don't you feel blessed kree
to be surrounded by guys
who treat you like guys
<@218176072615723008> they are shitty towards everyone, equally \o/
^accurate
I mean
Jebs a nazi, Vaules from the third world, i'm an asshole, jonny likes potatoes
In a way guys who are too nice are even worse to deal with
Assholes you can brush off
hey now
but guys who are too nice come across as creepy
or annoying
we are currenlty in negotiatons of becoming a second world coutnry
YEAH NOOX <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
and there isn't really a way to say "you are being too nice" because "too nice" isn't supposed to be a thing
Well
its not really being "nice" it's doing things and expecting things in return, let's be honest
^ lol
kind of
"dude I was your friend for ages, it is now time to sleep together"
It's nice to do nice things, you guys may not believe it but i'm actually a really nice person to the majority of people, for nothing but my own benefit
I make myself feel good by making others feel good
we know you're actually nice 😛
No
my favorite is " i got friendzoned by a prostitute"
IM AN ASSHOLE
<@112214247081017344> REKT
YOU TAKE THAT BACK KREE
you have an asshole
I think
😄
oh god what do i do
One of the guys at work recently had his girlfriend move to the US, right
and now she's breaking up with him
so i bought him a hot chocolate and some normal chocolate
😄
Is he allergic to chocolate?
Are you trying to help him kill himself?
Just saying, this might be relevant
did you mix them all together?!
No, but now i think about it, that would be pretty awesome
no it wouldn't
it would be lukewarm chocolate then
the coffee shop near work puts a bunch of fat marshmallows at the bottom of the cup, puts the hot chocolate on top and then mini marshmallows on top and whipped cream on top
It's fucking baller
that sounds like diabetes in a cup
you can't drink diabetes *stupid* <:DansGame:230336967722663937>
actually Kree
That's not funny
everyone knows it comes in cookie form
I could get diabetes eventually
it runs in my family
😄
I think you can drink diabetes
you should probably eat fewer sweets, then 😛
If you are vampire 👹
mr "look at my doughnuts" jerk with your tasty doughnuts showing them off..
hahahahahah 😄
My mum had type 1? (the diet one) and didnt diet properly so then she got type 2
like a fucking idiot
Lets avoid that, shall we?
some of us only have ONE doughnut place and we don't go there because the doughnuts are bad and they were recently involved in something the locals are calling "roachgate" <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
One of our close friends in California had type 1, it was rough
type 1 really sucks because you can't prevent it
I mean not that it's fun to live with type 2, but at least you can take preventative measures
She was a tiny stick person and had lots of mental barriers about eating because of her condition
And I can understand it, had some early scares with poor management
Type 1 is the diet one, yeah? I'm pretty sure
no, type 2 is
Type 1 is the genetic one
ahhh
Other way around then
Type 2 is the too much sugar one
My mum started with the dieting one and never followed the diet
so now she has to take insulin
😦
Idk about there, but the doctors here even helped her write up a diet plan and stuff like that, she was just too lazy
dieting is really hard - like, it's super simple, but it's hard
You would probably be referred to a nutritionist here
psychologically
And yeah, its a habit
Making good habits sucks :/
Supposedly if you can force yourself to do something for like 21 days, it bcomes a habit right?
Like, you can't just not eat. You have to eat and most people make food related decisions roughly 3x a day. So you have to *choose* to break a bad habit 3x a day
<@!111928201206382592> but our DnD sessions are more than 21 days apart
WE ARE DOOMED TO FAIl
haha

You can do DnD in play-by-post, that is what I did when I had nobody to play with
^That's a very terry pratchett thing to say, Kree
mixed success, particularly when it comes to combat

yeah, i can only imagine combat is a pain in the ass
just goes slowly is all
I'm rereading colour of magic atm, i bought it in ebook
I think i'm gonna work my way through the entire discworld series again
I have the last book in hardback
You guys would like the Magic 2.0 series, starts with "Off to be the Wizard"
I haven't brought myself to read it yet
because it makes me sad
how does it work with rolls
does the DM just roll everything for the players
I have a trilogy of rincewind books in hardback form, all in one big book, somewhere
No the forum is special and has a built in roller.
But i love Night's Watch, Monstrous Regiment and Going Postal
move to <#218177382606045195> !
Monstrous is one of my least favorite
I was having two conversations, one there and one here 😄
#multitasking
Postal and Night Watch are amazing
It's been a long time since i actually read any of them
but i remember enjoying Monstrous a lot, what did you dislike?
Wasn't that I disliked it, just felt inferior to the others
I'm wishing i didn't pick dragonborn sometimes, just because FUCK trying to draw dragons
Less good, not bad
I must have been like, 13 or so when i found the Terry Pratchett books
my cousin met her then boyfriend and he had LOADS of them
so i just borrowed them one at a time to read them
Equal Rites was my first one.
eventually i bought some of them myself
I think i actually started with colour of magic, because i had that influence of someone being able to give me them in order
Rincewind isn't my favorite either so I'm ok with not going that order.
Vimes and all of the witches are A++
Vimes is the best

You also might not like their motivations. But they have then.

DARGONS ARE SO HARD TO DRAW
nothing is hard to draw
any more than any other thing
hoomans are easy to draw
they are all shapes, lines, points of contrast
dargons are not
that just means you've practiced people more

oOOo how are you liking Stellaris?! <@!208978271608504320>
they sure are borkebot ....
i really like it cause there arent that many games where you can enslave othre races and do genetic experiments on them, scratches that itch you know
<@!208978271608504320> *of course* that is what you like <:NotLikeThis:230337263509176321>
the mutations are an interesting thing
because if for example a planet is different than your homeplanet (weather, radiation and so forth) the people could mutate
and gain new traits,
ooOo neat
and if theres enough of them they could rebel
and start a civil war
i had a minority who was pro cyborg engineering, whilst i forbid such things. and they started a war against me
neat 😄

settings>Hotkeys
Check push to talk and set hotkey
OBS won't let me set my normal push to talk as push to talk
@here Uno has an announcement <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
maybe it doesn't allow that hotkey for some reason
You have new handouts in Roll20, should show up in your journal -> Characters -> Notes

Its' a button between shift and z
Not there on us keyboards
Maybe why
They contain your plot hooks, trying to flesh out the events and motivations for why you are going to be on your way to Nightstone.  You have edit access so if you feel like we took liberties that aren't quite in line with your character, please change them and inform us.
We are going to start the session as everyone approaches Nightstone, which for convenience will be at the same time.  If you want to do some chatting and even RP about meeting on the road before the session, feel free to do that.  It's your story as much as the DMs
I'll be traveling most of today, so bug <@218176072615723008> with any questions.  Otherwise, enjoy!
When is our first session, oh mighty DM <@185950984692957186>
18th tentatively
that's a funny way of spelling "Kree" you have there, <@!111928201206382592>
Are you doing the first session?
<@!112214247081017344> <@218176072615723008> <@227523189687844864> dota 2 beta in 10 mins?
😄
Is the new patch playable then?
no, tommorow i think
this is just patch notes and test client
Test client is playable tonight
That's why I said beta 😄
Implying Dota is out of beta
ill be joining you in a few
updating my test client
Didn't have the test client, so i have like 9 gigs to download.
haha
wont take too long
especially not with everyone downloading it at the same time
I wonder if you could just copy your normal dota files over to fill the 9gb
then do the update
11 minues remaining according to steam client
nice internet
So it's fine
30 minutes for me
website is erroring
come join me on voice
bozos
Uno said to bug me with any questions
and I will *be* at the first session and helping
and I am aware of all the character stuff including all of your sheets and hooks
so you can ask me questions 😛

Morning everyone! When is everyone down to dota? Test client until patch hits, of course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMGlylXwY_8
This is amazing
Radiance...why didnt we think of that
i like treads, echo saber desolator
and maxing the passive
oneshots for life
but if you go radiance, you just sit on top of the trees
and never fight
it makes his ulti better, because the monkeys beneffit from atack modifiers
dunno about mjornir
also going 1/1/4
makes you oneshot supports
well 3 hit them
yeah
in all seriousness
passive is the one to max
because lvl 1 stick stun thing does the same damage
and benefits from passive
yeah maelstrom works on the ulti monkeys
so does orb of venom and desolator
i imagine diffusal as well
and none are orbs, right?
blight orb is
the rest arent anymore
so does basher and a mkb
and lol battlefury cleave
yeah, so many options
I think this guy is gonna be a really good addition
maybe OP till we figure out the counters
stuns and tree cutting abilites
blademail and atack slow things aswell
also refresher ulti just restarts the spell
the ulti monkeys get the rapier damage aswell
yeah
the Q does too
yeah
ult is pretty good for countering a gank
you need to be in it though which shouldn't be hard if you climb a tree
but yeah Q benefits from your damage and the passive increaded dmg
although diminishingly or whatever
speaking of games, i listened to the Metal Gear Revengance soundtrack and now i want to play that game again
its a good game
straw has just gone to get some food
but i'm down to play after that, if anyone wants to?
<@!112214247081017344> <@227523189687844864>
Just about to start on some food aswell
Can play in 40 min or something maybe
i gotta study and make food
but definetly later
Keep practicing <@!112214247081017344>
round 10 or whateve
fml
<@218176072615723008> how are you feeling?
also, <@227523189687844864> lemme know when you are ready, i think we got jeb to play too
Ok still getting over stupid flu 😷
Thank you for asking
are you gonna come play the new patch today at some point? 😃
I miss video games and friends
So I hope so
I hope so too!
so much to learn together
Official patch probably hits live client tonight at some point
but its on test client all day today, if you fancy downloading that and joining us at some point

@here anyone else here with the test client want to play? we need +1
So riddle me this, friends.
I can't see where they hid STR/DEX/INT in the new HUD
Do any of you know where it went?
hold alt
DEX? what sorcery are you talking about <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
ok so it's hidden behind the mysteries of ALT like all the other info
alt = god mode
AGI
not DEX
too much fucking DnD reading 😄
People were whining about the day night cycle
but its actually easier to see now
and pressing alt also gives you a countdown to next day/night
the ui items are too small, and the store is shit
The store isn't great, i'll give you that
but i like the UI items as they are
i find it tricky when swapping out items from your backpack
ALSO you cant click on an item in your inventory and see what its contained in the store
thats probably the biggest offender
I always right click>view in store
anyway
What they really should be doing with this new UI, is making it scaleable
so you can resize it to your needs
Shane unmodded me in his chat <:SwiftRage:230337386557603842>
Same
I'm pretty sure we are all unmodded
Yea, but I have been his friend for like 5 years
He probably had a purge at some point if he hadnt seen people around for a long time
<@218176072615723008> he remembered the last game he played with us
and said "never again" <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
well fuck that, I went to go wish him happy stream anniversary, but unmodded <:DansGame:230336967722663937>
the funny thing is, i think im still a mod in pyrions chat but not shanes, lol
Oh, maybe not
Oh yeah, i am 😄

<@227523189687844864> you ready for more games?
<@!112214247081017344> any luck?
need 2 minutes
Alternatively you could be someone girls don't want to run from? 💃
Having both options is good. A winning personality but also massive quads to ensure the victory
<@185950984692957186> https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/monk-monastic-traditions
<@218431140841652225> so a buff barbarian with high Charisma. Sounds... familiar <:KappaPride:230337103039430656>
<@!111928201206382592> neat will look later. Like in a year. When I have learned Dota again and the DND campaign has crashed and burned with Jonny running to the hills carrying a willing partner over each shoulder
Also loving this pathfinder mobile game
Its just the UA for monk
Sucks the adventures only five gold the first one you beat them
So you have to play quests to grind gold but they are a bit buggy
yeah
UA is mostly boring, gives some cool additional options i guess
Trying to keep things basic. It is complex enough to start up 😛
But soon! Unless my big work meetings Thursday and Friday destroy my soul!
well, i meant the monk one specifically, its pretty boring
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5hyxmr/you_vs_the_guy_she_told_you_not_to_worry_about/
you can do it Uno
<@!111928201206382592> so apparently quest mode isn't as bugged as I thought, your old characters are just hidden under an "experienced" tab. Suddenly a dozen people to kill off
<@!112214247081017344> Danke señor
I won't be downloading the test patch over hotel wifi so I'll continue the prep work I guess
It's ok though, I am totally not building up Sunday to be impossible because of high expectations 🤗
as long as i can punch someone and buy <@152225516668190721> and <@218431140841652225> a beer i'll be happy
YEHHHH

Good title on that song <@!112214247081017344>
Someone has to be responsible for dragging Jonny out into the road and back to adventuring
i was listening to the games soundtrack and forgot this song existed
the other shanties have more lyrics to learn
theres also this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_RoX7kOs_I
i approve
im called hugh mungus though
:/
i know
but the other ones are hard
ill work a nickname of johnny into my bio sure
just for you
i am awfull at learning lyrics
like terible
but a sailor needs to know a shanty or two
no doubt
@here actually gonna play with pupper while the sun is still out
i'll be back later!
see ya ❤
Enjoy 😄
have fun

I fucking hate busses on an early morning holy shit
I got up at 7:30 to go to my doctors appointment at 8:20, TWO busses just didn't turn up! The third was late and got stuck in traffic, so I missed my appointment, wtf
Also everyone forgot something in all the excitement of 7.0: no jugg arcana

straws downloading the actual patch
once she's done we're down for dotes
I'll play
im downloadin too
Just playing some poe right now
simon desynced and ripped yesterday
gg
haha
I never really got back into it after my first rip
I'm streaming so i can catch my own rip eventually
hahaha
inb4 thats the cause of the death
my download timer is going up gg
so this sunday at 5.30 uk time is that right?
enef you listened to 4 your eyez only yet?
Nah, is it good?
Yeah!
Even if Uno can't make it, we should do a quick session to get everyone's characters together on the road
half way through
classic cole atm
deep as balls
haha
My overnight download on crappy hotel internet stopped early so no bot games for me tonight.
how longs straw got left?
like an hour i think, not sure
ah cool
gioves me time ot get my shit done first
We're watching dr strange whilst we wait, so it'll probably be about that long
cool
ill work away here till yous are ready sure
<@185950984692957186> maybe a nice coffee shop with wifi after work for your download?
you could sit, sip, read DnD stuff, and get the patch!
The internet works, but laptop went to sleep after I told it not to. Or maybe the internet connection reset first that does happen here. Uggg
I'm giving you a reason to get fancy coffee here!
But I don't drink coffee <:shaneThump:165083392109445120>
^
<@185950984692957186> they have tea and muffins!
And they serve expensive coffee not fancy. We have an espresso machine and I make wifey cappuccino most mornings.
+husband points gj!
They come in handy for sure
I actually knew all of that (except the part about the espresso machine), and yet I forgot. I probably blocked out such a horrible character flaw.
<:wizardhat:240139380658798603>
<:Kappa:230337062652477440>
oh my god
I say dont update at all, keep 6.88 alive, keep Antimage relevant <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
It isn't a character flaw. It means there is more coffee in the world for you
KappaWizard
The dream!
<@185950984692957186> I see you've been trained in rhetoric
Lol
I'm pretty sure <@!146024532052803585> doesn't like coffee, either 😦
Verbal sparring for more than a decade with an English and Poli Sci major will do that.
pretty sure?
Yea, he only seems happy when it's full of cream and sugar
Kree thinks she failed her perception roll and is metagaming it
wow
I like my coffee the way I like my females, black and with 2 e's in them
huh
what's the 'e'?
2 es?
2 earthsakers?
Ex
ecstacy
....
scrubs ruined my joke
why would you put that in coffee
it would taste terrible
yall suck
coffEE
lol
THAT IS NOT A THING YOU PUT IN COFFEE
already has 2 ees
coffEE ok ok joke makes more sense now
oh lord
the joke is i like women that are drugged up
duh
ok ok
Now I get it 😦
i give up
We see the thought process now
<:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
Usually I am on the other side of explaining the thought process + joke
I also like my women like I like my beer - stout and bitter
thats easier to understand
that one makes complete sense
I'm still waking up
also fits my dnd char
yes it does
Can I introduce you to Kree <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
HAHAHA
rude
quite likely, yes
but I laughed out loud, so it is all good right? 😄
I mean it's true, but still *rude* <:DansGame:230336967722663937>
😛
first line of this song is ' i will never stop like a marathon in boston'
wow
...
what in the world are you listening to?
J Cole
my discover weekly
nah done with coles album
<@218176072615723008> I also just realized we missed a grand opportunity, why wasn't Rolen a METAL BARD
hes too mature for that joke im sure
because it already hurt my voice too much to try and get in character
Well you nearly had Enef playing an escaped princess
Tyrhan is too fancy to be metal
YEAH
if you had played i would be a princess right now
What, you decide to switch when you realize co-DM Kree can kill you off?
nah, when she wasn't playing and i realized we had no healer
You do realize other players can stab you in the face right?  Like, it isn't encouraged and such....
is Tyrhan a cheap hearthstone copy`
??
lol, and then <@152225516668190721> shows up as a cleric late to the party "Hey guys, wait when did the party start again?  It's ok, I brought some holy water jello shots!"
yeah
<@152225516668190721> already the most usefull in the party
It's ok, thanks to Nick now i don't have to creepily touch you to heal you, i just sing at you
singing at people is the best
Song of Rest is level 2, right?
yeah
but i have healing word
level 1
word
i like touching enef why you do this =[
DWARVES NEED LOVE TOO
Did anyone have problems with their plot hooks?
Don't worry, i'm a fancy dargon
<@!111928201206382592> we don't know that because you can't draw yourself <:KappaRoss:230337114116587520>
none of them have read their plot hooks except enef
:<
Dota patch mayhem
I knew mine before you posted it on roll20 cos i asked for it
Also, check <#254373328049930240>
ive done like 5% of my char sheet
What about it?
nobody panic
i may not be there
Me and jonny were discussing this sunday, if you can't make it, we'll make a session anyway to have everyone meet
BOOO
i read my plot hook
Gotcha
just need to ask <@152225516668190721> some questions
ive a football christmas dinner
i may even miss that
Yeah, <@152225516668190721> is the vaguest currently as far as plot hooks go
girl ive been seeing is leaving to go back toamerica on monday morning
gna try and get to spend sunday night with ehr
^stop ignoring my fancy dargon ways <@!112214247081017344> and <@152225516668190721>
anyonw up for a game of dota 2 episode 2?
And if Jonny needs to miss we can work that out, no reason he can't wander of to Nightstone after you guys especially since you aren't officially a party
bow chicka wow wow
im a charismatic barb
<@123523238021169155> JA!
ill be off finding girls with 2 ees
giggity
yeah, i'm sure we can pick up a dwarven barb in any tavern in the land 😄
or find him rolled over in a ditch
<@123523238021169155> me and straw will be available in like 40 mins or so
his pants nowhere to be found
ima be round for next gamer too, still workin on some stuff
scratch that, I don't want Jonny describing walking around confidently with no pants on
Why wouldn't Jonny join the party at the start?
read butts and dragons
he's potentially not available on sunday
Also, what are two ees? Is that like, two eternal envys? <:KappaRoss:230337114116587520>
id love that
sploosh
ok i see
<@!111928201206382592>
soudn good
jeb
join
need +1
sec
Jonny, you should still finish your character sheet
So you can be ready to drop in
it's probably easy enough to add a dwarf in town
yeah
ive a busy week but it is on my list to do
just need time to sit down and work on it
It's not supposed to be stressful. I can help you out if you want
^same, always here to help if you have questions
What a guy! <:plusone:249546217795747840>
yeah ill let you know when im free and we can work something out
prolly thursday some time
Sure, whenever you want
I am still getting over flu so I am around and not too mentally engaged in anything this week
It's definetely easier for kree to help cos she can actively see and mess with your character sheet 😄
😛
i read that as the mess that is my char sheet
your character sheet is fine
thats cause its mostly empty ;P
exactly
As long as the important stuff is on there
You'll pick up what die to roll when pretty quickly whilst playing, when it comes down to it
if you set it up right you can just click the ability
im a relatively quicklearner thankfully
but its not necessary the first go around
_attacks the monster_
I missed :<
<@!208978271608504320> I saw your game last night with Nick, btw <:NotLikeThis:230337263509176321> ... Think it was a bit past your bedtime.
well fuck me
Learning the macros and the roll20 app is adding an extra layer of confusion, for now let's stick to just getting the basic character stuff down ^^ 😄
hahahahahha
😄
NICE
5 damage!
Yea, agreed... for now 😛

Poor dotabuff, this patch has not been kind to their website. At least not the mobile version
classic kyle
plays new hero and feeds
😄
How else do you learn the new hero?!
I think the directed camera is fucked
when they just took rax it sent me to their fountain
brb anyway
Make a reddit thread I am sure there is nothing going on over at r/dota2 and it will quickly rise to the top <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
when i got into my first game i had 20 fps for 10 minutes, they are plenty mad 😄
<@227523189687844864> <@!208978271608504320> break for food then wanna play more dota?
Haha yikes
Maybe it is ok I can't play this week
i had to restart dota and set everything to lowest to fix it
i'm just waiting for <@218431140841652225> to finish getting buff really
<@!111928201206382592>  had something similar, my CPU usage went straight up to 100% even on low settings, restarting dota a couple of times fixed it
yeah, its weird
I had 0 issues on the test client
It worked fine for 2 full days
brb getting tea
<@185950984692957186> how goes the work trip?

not right now, but glhf
Sure
<@!208978271608504320> fancy a game?
<@218176072615723008> check steam
ok

VICIOUS
ok leaving the cold room now <:DansGame:230336967722663937>
So Kree is perfect but the guy with the high pitched voice payed you off? That Enef...
I think he is saying help them with their DND characters <:KappaRoss:230337114116587520>
<@!111928201206382592> dragonborn tokens in roll20 are $6.50
So you are going to be a kobold unless you can find or draw your own token
LOL
wat
That's so expensive for a token
They are usually token packs
But you can't get an individual one
but isnt there like default tokens or ones that come with STk?
yes
kobolds
<:KappaClaus:230337078867656704>
@everyone ok friends you can now go to roll20 and pick your tokens
remember you can still add avatars above for those of you with, uh, not so representative tokens *cough*
I can probably make one using googlefu art 😄
Sure!
Does it have to be top down?
or ?
I might just make custom ones for the entire party that are a bit better than these...maybe, for now people should still select these
All of the SKT NPC tokens are portraits but a lot of the free roll20 resources are top down. It will probably be a mixture
I think people need to absolutely pick something from these before Sunday since we can always go back in and improve them.
And yes customization is welcome but functionality first!
The idea is to not put it off so we aren't all faffing with setup in the first session
I prefer the portrait stuff personally, also i went into the character sheet, hit edit and it just says Avatar, name and Bio and info
ok, maybe i have to linke for you
if you want to pick one I can do that
Just find the bardiest/fanciest looking dragonish creature thats blueish
XD
i'm fine with that for now
ok
you sure you don't want to at least look at the options I put up? <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
<@185950984692957186> no appreciation!
I saw
but none of them look like bards
and they are all greenish
ok
i even tried clicking on one to select it
and it did nothing
<@218176072615723008> get used to it. Players are soul sucking vermin
They *are*. Let's punish them. 😈
ok I'm picking you the bottom one since it is the closest to blue and has a helm that could, in theory, be disguising your dragony features
I dont want them disguising
I want them showing off!
...
You fool
WE'RE DISGUISING THAT YOUR TOKEN IS A KOBOLD
<:NotLikeThis:230337263509176321>
😄
I'll fix it, no worries
Just in game right now
so can't do much
ok do me a favor and see if you can move the token around when you can
I'm sick <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
/nick Undying
<@218176072615723008> i can
haha yea I just saw while i was reading a thing on scale xD
how many pixels big do they have to be etc?
<@!111928201206382592> you should be able to turn it around and have it face different directions
https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how%20to%20make%20roll20%20tokens
top four look promising
it feels bad, but i'll probably just steal someones dragonborn from google xD
also, this is nothing like Tyrhan but it has the closest in clothing i've seen https://68.media.tumblr.com/fda86a4cb46e02e623b16d6910ce0921/tumblr_oe5r7jL68r1rnhan2o1_500.png
It's a kobold not a dragonborn but yeah
XD
Is that deekin? 😄
TIL: I can force players to listen to Space Jam <:KappaRoss:230337114116587520>
OOH Lord.

😄
Crop in on the face, cut out a circle and color it!
yep
will do that probably before sunday
How you feeling about sunday? more than likely gonna be able to or still unsure?
your drawing is *really* good, <@!111928201206382592> ! ❤ it
love your character, too 😄
I'll be home barring some car problems. The issue is more if I will feel the energy for it after a day of driving and the meetings. I have a preliminary meeting tomorrow morning and then basically meetings all day Thursday and Friday, so won't have a good idea until Saturday afternoon.
It's really not mine 😄
haha
I stole it from google

I wish i could draw dragons like that
how many bagpipe playing dragonborn bards are there?!
who knows
but i google "dragonborn bagpipes"
and found it :d
The Internet is a magical place. Coloring looks nice!

there you go
Give it a border though?
Preferably a circular mask of a wood texture, possibly maple or elm <:KappaRoss:230337114116587520>
How are you coloring BTW? Layer masks or something?
well, i learned this a very long time ago
Or bucket fill on the same layer?
but i just create a new layer
zoom right in
and polygonal lasso tool
the lines
and fill
then i "overlay"
Gotcha
so the black comes through
its an old traditional art colouring technique i learned

close enough
My gimp/ps skills are super weak but I love what can be done
I love what i USED to be able to do 😄
Cool cool cool!
these days i hate everything i do
I can probably ACTUALLY draw the rest of the part when i get descriptions
Too much time in Dota
but for now im the only one who gets to be fancy
TF2 is what killed it, honestly, i stopped arting to play competitive tf2
also <@218176072615723008> i LOVE tyrhan 😄 he's obnoxious in all the best ways ❤
Well you did meet Straw that way so we'll call it a net positive
https://www.heroforge.com/
we could also use this to design our characters, screenshot it and i can photoshop it into a token

😄

This thing is so cool
<@185950984692957186> <@218176072615723008>

$24.99 to print a mini of tyrhan
"only"
I would say that's pretty good value to 3D print a mini of your personalised character
I know, it is an amazing service
IIRC Penguin has used it if you want to talk to someone about them
I wouldn't print anything as of yet, not until we've lasted 6 months with the same characters 😄
But yeah, it might be a cool way of doing everyone's tokens
How about a year... for next Christmas... 😉
INCENTIVIZATION
haha
😄
I'll still be here, will you? 😄
If we're still playing in a year then we have to do a live session at least once, everyone has to fly somewhere
You the player may be... but your character?  Hmmmm.....
Haha
how are you gonna handle death?
Perma death + reroll a new character or res?
<@218176072615723008> the greatest news!  Sami and the rescued Great Dane (Lena) met today at the apartment dog park and were friendly
Something to consider when we get there I think.
It is a complex thing.  Some people may feel like a character death is good, serves the story well and they are ready to try something fresh.  Others may be more attached.
yeah
I guess part of what i used to do as an artist, make comics and original characters, gives me kind of a lackadaisical view on characters
Resurrection is a thing that happens, although at higher levels and at cost, so maybe a side quest to get that done with the dead characters player getting to play a NPC for it
And i'm very easy and quick to jump between them, for sure
But could you let your dragonborn bard die before completing his quest?!
HIS STORY?!
Haha
<@!112214247081017344> Oh no 😦
<@185950984692957186> \o/
So resurrection as written is available at cleric level... 13.  And costs 1000gp in consumed resources.
😄
There is also the reincarnate druid spell at druid level...  9, but that is actually a randomized race and type
http://i.imgur.com/yXTL0tm.png
this is how i imagine straws character to look
Though ive heard zero descriptions
Negatory
damn
all i know is "tiefling warlock"
http://i.imgur.com/UP7CXf7.png
Jonny 😄
lol
"dwarf barbarian"
the hands though

I hate how youtoubers nowadays go for the hourlong videos to maximise ad-revenue
as opposed to amusing/informative 20 minute segments?
SELLOUTS! Kappa
so video makers trying to target maximum revenue makes sense, but I wonder that the reasoning from youtube itself is for making that the target
I HAVE FFINISHED THE PATCH NOTES
FINALLY
GOOD! NOW LOAD UP A LOBBY GAME AND LOOK THE MAP CHANGES

BURN THE FROG, HE TOOK MY JUNGLE AWAY 🔥 <:OSfrog:230337314952445963> 🔥
Offlane is amazing now, though. ALL HAIL <:OSfrog:230337314952445963>
"oh, they are trilaning? I'll just go kill these two camps, eat this bounty rune, and drink up that fountain. Now I am lvl 3 and this shitty trilane is lvl 1-2. Rinse and repeat, only drink a salve while jungling instead of well. Now I am lvl 5 and this shitty trilane is lvl 3. Rinse and repeat, now I am level 7 and have my ult and some items and this shitty trilane is level 5. time to slay"  <:Kreygasm:230337238951657472>
this of course includes running back to lane whenever -shitty trilane-pushes it into your tower
"oh, they are trilaning? I'll just go kill .. oh these camps are strong, eat my ... where is my bounty rune? drink my juice. My mid is crying because the supports ganked him mid, noob. At least i am lvl 3 now. Just gotta wait two minutes/five for juice for the camps to respawn. Then its time to slay
Oh man you need to go to **<#224911970204123136>**
I think offlane needs a hero that can kill camps
to get the most out of it
I got really lucky yesterday on doom and got the health regen creep lvl 1
and since I randomed I had the 💰 to build armor
People always make fun of me there because i dont have the cool cosmetics ... I hate <#224911970204123136> <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
hey there, champ! buck up! if you fail out of <#224911970204123136>, there's always #league_school
maybe i will! They at least have jungle camps to farm!
go to lane when it is near tower
farm jungle when it isn't
💰 profit 💰
I wrote him using a wand but otherwise yeah
I think you hang out with them offlaners too much Kree. Have you forgotten how toxic they can be, always trying to limit your potential, killing couriers and friendly supports ....They are not nice people.
We carrys have to stick together now that our safelane is not safe anymore
Safelane hasn't been safe for a while, though <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
Come to the dark side...
And mid is a battle over whose supports come help or not
Safelane, though
That's the *true* solo lane
The lane of the Gods
unhindered by friend or foe
i dont like it Kree, thre is too much magic around... even my food is enchanted now. Dark sorcery has warped the jungle creeps, they have grown vicous and root you. Fountains on magic in my HOME BASE! Nothing good can come from this ... nothing good at all ........

<@!218176072615723008> will you tell me tales of patches for 9 hours, pleeeeease?
Sure, let me just open an Excel spreadsheet real fast
Now, if we put in the new creeps and create a formula for their individual spawn timers - look, guys, anyone can do this - and then a column for lane creeps and the comparative XP granted by a given wave based on the in-game timer

You know, there are almost no resources online that are used predominantly by women that aren't shitty ad-infested garbage
I should start another youtube channel to go along with m Dota channel.
elaborate woman
I'm not a woman, I'm Purge.
elaborate, ..... PURGE
Purge women?
So I'm trying to declutter my bathroom cabinets and looking for a method. The only decent site seems to be <unfuckyourhabitat.com>. The rest are full of so many ads that they make navigating the site a nightmare. How am I supposed to know which mustache combs to keep and which to throw away?
uBlock origin
thats not a site
I have adblock
In Chrome
But I was using Safari like a fool
Well, there's your problem then. Safari is the reason for a bushy mustache
The point is that there are no good resources that don't require adblockers to load. Unlike my channel, which provides good content with a minimal ad experience.
I hate cooking.. Imagine if there was som kind of service that would make food for you and deliver it.
That'd be cool
I think they call that takeout
buy a courier, they are only 100g
really cheap nowadays
I tried. The donkey kept eating all my food..
That is because Dota only has veggies and fruits in it.
actually not that cheap, 3.511,28 EUR is the current price for 100g gold
Shitty un-American game, where are my carbs and meat!
fresh meat?
Well we aren't really about freshness so... Maybe?
i heard that souls from an urn of shadows are delicious and healthy for you and i bet there is a recipe somewhere to turn swords into meat

NOW WRITE YOUR BACKSTORY <:SwiftRage:230337386557603842>
Mine is pretty much done, i just need to figure out how me vaule and Nick met up in Waterdeep/on the road

cos i want to be a part of their party
ALONG WITH A CRUSHED CAN OF ICED TEA
okokokok
Oh, I meant that tirade specifcally at <@152225516668190721>
complete with iced tea reference
how long should the backstory be
<@185950984692957186> make my token the one i sent
honestly, whatever you want.  Just gives us something to build off of.  If you want to develop your character as we go along that is fine, just means we won't be actively exploiting your backstory for tie ins, etc
For example Enef has contracted a rare Dragonborn illness from his parents that will kill him off within a year, so we have a set timeframe to get you guys finished
<@!218176072615723008> whoops, I wasn't supposed to spoil that was I? <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
damnnnnnnnn
gotcha
<@185950984692957186>
rules question
When you "die" and then you get hit
do you instantly die cos you are negative
or do you lose a death saving throw?
No, you get a failed death savings throw
Thought so
It says it right there 😛
I just happened to read over it two nights ago so it is fresh
Nick was confused
And usually you won't be kicked while you are down, I suspect it will only be an issue with AoE attacks
Or... well... shitty party members ;P
Well
Giants are vicious
it could knock me down and stomp on me
Who said anything about giants?
They weren't in the "what would you like to see" lists
they are a key part of the module, though 😛
at least, i learned as much from the PA stuff this year

Pebkac, never had a single issue with any windows 10 updates, updated the month after it was released, worked on upwards of probably 1000 win10 machines at work with very low percentage of issue, stuff that's usually caused by driver issues on the manufacturers end of things.
Everyone seems to blame Microsoft for Manufacturers not updating things, updates *need* to happen to your operating system. I'm sure more intelligent people than I can explain why that is!
I had to go back and try and reset a Windows 7 machine like 3 weeks ago, my god is it obtuse to do anything with that operating system. Something that should be relatively easy and intuitive was complicated because windows 7 requires you to have made a recovery media, have a recovery partition or have some kind of software from the manufacturer to reset the machine. But it's different for every manufacturer, some of them include it some of them don't. It was a very frustrating experience, with Win10 I could have just held shift, clicked restart and reset the machine. Simple :D

oh
didnt she have like one actually good policy
She had *one*?
and about as big a chance to win as me
did she?
That's generous
Kappa
She had about the same amount of votes as Harambe
And I think Harambe would have been better
i still have harambe as an 86d item at the restaurant
So in the swing states that Trump won, he only won by a sliver of votes
nobody dares clean it for the curse it might imply
less than the amount of people that voted for Jill Stein
right
well it was a big problem
people were so sure hilly would win
Well
People are idiots
oh
it was here dakota pipeline stance i liked
i think
getting charged for spraypainting a bulldozer

not really
It really, really is

Didn't nick uninstall
I mean, he was always gonna be better than us eventually
cos A)he cares more about ranked B)he plays games as a job C)he's actually good at video games :D
i feel betrayed
that he lied to us
Just needed to reinstall
De salt the dota copy
lets resalt him later
im down
oh he's resalted <:Keepo:230337123348250624>
I'm up for some dotes if a slot opens up
pre-salted
seems toi be a queue
I can wait for a while
i just got home
so yeah
gonna chill, hang with straw etc
if shes playign we prolly have another 5  ppl
nah, she needs to head off early-ish tonight
j
kk
I mean we lost again so
A loss is just a closer step to win
can't lose forever
prove it
you gotta play the all random. no 5 stack can match the power of garbage lineups, which we are all good at
We're excellent at garbage lineups
that ar lastn ight was aids
we got a total garbo team
they got a baller team
Still won
only by the power of me tilting them
did we win
You tilted yourself, also
i had teh game closed liek three times
in the first 5 mins
ready to leave
:D
then i pout the old wow pvp soundtrack on
and we just won somehow
Surprisingly we're good players really
who knew
3k hours of dota
would mean we could play the game
we should only play cd
so we an blame the drafter
the thing is right
The two games that triggered everyone
I picked, not randomed
but everyone blames randoms as if they are the reason we lose
I mean, if someone picks 3 melees, picking a fourth probably aint great. That's all i'm saying :D
i blame picks
should random everytime
that way we blame rng atleast
I am  sorry
but Bacon should not carry
he is a nice enough dude
but he makes awful decisions
I dont even know who that is
we jus tlost to the worst AM
none of us are really good carries tbh
I think I have seen
since hte last time u saw jeb am?
OHHHH
there is a difference between "really good" and "competent enough to know not to run in 1v3 alone when they have been killing you in lane"
like
I don't expect us to be pro lvl
but basic competence
helps
if you are carry
anyway, whatever
new broken shore boss up
make sure to do it with tokens
I can dotes p.much anytime now
did nick uninstall again?
he went grocery shoping
Surprised he didnt pay someone to do it for him
thats his normal M.O for doing things
<:Kappa:230337062652477440>
lets reassemble when hes back sure
He is also being personally coached by Purge
i mean we have vaule
same thing
<@!218176072615723008>
you coming to play
not if we are playing a picking mode
all random or i am out
idc what we play
i just want to play
we can play hots for all i care
:D
I got this fucking battle pass
haven't finished 1 quest
just getting really irritated
bought the upgraded one and was so excited
now just feels like I wasted my money
Like it doesn't mean shit if you don't win
I mean, i gained a level
:D
but yeah, idc, i will play whatever everyone wants to play
I just want to play video games with friends
waow
good bot
YES
<@185950984692957186>
I love brokebot so much
He doesn't respond if you dont type
so rude
you have to say something to him
<@!218176072615723008> whats up?
bwaahahahhahaha
<@185950984692957186> scroll up to waht brokebot said about you
rofl
ROFL
oh i have to lose 3 times
so that is the key
He shut down <@!111928201206382592> 's bromance?
I am so sorry mate 💔
I have a 50% win rate with battle pass Kree
I think you are just choosing bad friends to play with
I mean I played with you <:Kappa:230337062652477440>
And we won
We won a game we shouldn't have won, i should add
:D
http://i.imgur.com/HGPYGpp.jpg
I am like... 1-4 on the battle pass
I have to go out with JOhn
for 10 minutes
if people can wait
sure
i can come play all random then
we have me dino and jonny right now
although we did have one epic stomp them game... and started throwing... and then "Stats not recorded"
and thats it
RIP 2.9k points
you're 1mmr now then?
no, I mean battlepass points
400 from quest, 2.5 from stacking the group wagers
lol
you nerds have too much money
buy me compendium levels
Once i get the underwater map perhaps 😛
until then, it is every feeder for themself!
WOW
you dotaing?
By that logic I am surprised NooX doesn't have a robot grocery shop for him... and then he gets banned from the grocery store and has to buy a facelift to get back in
Me?  No, trying to get packed for the family beach reunion
We will leave... eventually... maybe...
we will be soonish probably
waiting on kree i think
ok
what?
How does that make sense?
Nick has on numerous occasions used apps to get people to bring him coffee
instead of getting it himself?
And NooX has used bots to farm in WoW for him!
Made complete sense in the madhouse that is my brain
THER ARE APPS THAT BRING YOU COFFEE
?!
like fiverr and shit
i think
You pay some dude to go grab your coffee and bring it to you
"I am not a robot I am genuine shopper. Look at all of my human purchases."
-Nooxbot
Nick is the expert
Yeah, you order coffee, and it pours out of the earphone jack.
I think I need Ollie to write all of my content
for my bots
he is clearly a genius
fair enough
I think that's the highest praise i'll ever recieve.
<:shrugz:271443274588356608>
😄
I think he's saying that <@!152225516668190721> 's into kink
LLOOOL
😦
lol
WAOW
rekt
rekt
rip
savage
WOW
ahahahaha
DELETED
I think Uno is right
we shouldn't be allowed to raise a bot
No we definetely should
I love our child
Wow brokebot knows me
Sticks and stones may break my bones, / But chains and whips excite me?
Nick we have a coach slot
if you want it
you can watch us get salty
nice
instead of experiencing it
come coach me nick
i need u
big ugly turds doesn't sound like a win

(most recent is after CM game)
Played dota.  Uninstalled dota.
words of wisdom right there^^
Faustus:
Then, Dota 2, receive this scroll, A deed of gift, of body and of soul. But yet conditionally, that thou perform All covenants, and articles, between us both.
Dota 2:
Faustus, I swear by hell and Gabecifer To effect all promises between us both.
Faustus:
Then hear me read it, Dota 2, On these conditions following.
First, that Faustus may be a spirit in form and substance.
Secondly, that Dota 2 shall be his servant, and be by him commanded.
Thirdly, that Dota 2 shall do for him, and bring him whatsoever.
Fourthly, that he shall be in his chamber or house invisible.
Lastly, that he shall appear to the said Jeb Faustus, at all
times, in what shape and form soever he please.
I, Jeb Faustus of Wittenberg, Doctor, 9k player, by these presents, do
give both body and soul to Gabecifer, Prince of the East, and
his minister Dota 2, and furthermore grant unto them
that four and twenty years being expired, and these articles
written being inviolate, full power to fetch or carry the
said Jeb Faustus’ body and soul, flesh, blood, into their ha-
bitation wheresoever.
By me Jeb Faustus.
Dota 2:
Speak, Faustus, do you deliver this as your deed?
Faustus:
Ay, take it, and the devil give thee good of it.


im drunk, and im wondering why jeb is spamming
im not gonna read it becuase thats effort
love you all, nite
Not at all used to the spring summer light yet
It's 4 am

The puppies are wondering why it takes humans so long to wake up when there is already light for the beach

I'll play

nvm
oOOo Dino stream
<@!123523238021169155> game is hard 😦
I can play some dota in like an hour and 30ish minutes
But only if you guys promise to not be awful people
i probably wont play at that time, so youre good
I mean, I don't have the screenshot on hand from last night but you weren't there Pablo so I don't blame you :D
I don't think I was awful. Extremely mega-tilted, maybe

what am i looking at
3550 gold worth of pain
that is part of supporting though
buying wards is not the worst thing in the world. the only reason I didn't help you out that game was because I went super hard with helping in a previous enigma game and we lost
so was trying to get out teamfight items asap
since warding didn't seem to be helping
like
support items in general are not very exciting
Sure.
you guys tilted already?
gfg
won 3 matches in the past week
yea I'm pretty tilted
we make dota way harder than it needs to be
Speaking terrible, hots anyone?
<@227523189687844864> can I challenge you in hearthstone?
we both get 80g
Sure
lord that quest rogue deck again 😛
haha
Don't have any other decks made
didn't get a good opening hand w/ my deck
and now i know
i'm being quest rogued <:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
😛
quest rogued
😄
<:BibleThump:230336916837498881>
I actually could have done ok w/ a better opening hand
ah well 😛
ez 80g
Yeah
I missplayed one turn
Forgot i used the coin already
So could have had the quest one turn earlier.
But it's not unbeatable at all.
If you don't draw bounce cards ytou're screwed
<@!111928201206382592>  whjen u on for dota?
I knkow it's not unbeatable <@227523189687844864>

<@218431140841652225>
I think so
whoops wrong channel
LOL
LOL
😄
why did he quote you
that is on purpose
testing a thing
yeh
im good to go
huh
gna eat quickly before sure
I recognise some of that...
from the screenshots
did you have to reset a bunch of stuff?
He is being basically completely rewritten
Not the interaction with Discord stuff
but using a better library for generating text
OH GOD HE IS SELF AWARE
He's pulling full sentences from us now though.
Not as random as before
yea, way better library
Now I just need to figure out what this library uses to respond with context and we are golden
I prefer the random
Its funnier when he tries to make sense on his own
Kinda wierd when you know the things he writes.
Although most of the earlier stuff didn't make sense at all instead
well like, I want him to respond to me saying "what do you think of dota" with a sentence about dota, for example
or at least try to 😉
Yeah
So did you remake him in Python like you were talking about, or did you end up doing something else?
naa still node
LOL
xD
The full sentences are pretty funny, i'll give it that
It's like quotes from yesteryear or something
uh
I am having him say that to test a condition
ah
😛
ok good
LOL
😮 😮
XD
<:LUL:230373447232913409>
:D
Its like he loves quoting me
Because you talk too much
shut up axe
😄
omg
BWAHAHAHAHAAHHAAH
ahaha
XD
hnnnnng
I guess we will just have to see how stable he is
xD
<@!152225516668190721> wanna dotes?
